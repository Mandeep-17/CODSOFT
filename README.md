**A. Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction**

The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Dataset link:https://github.com/Mandeep-17/CODSOFT/blob/main/titanic.csv

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

**B. Task 2: IRIS Flower Classification**

Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements

Dataset link:https://github.com/Mandeep-17/CODSOFT/blob/main/IRIS.csv

Train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

**C. Task 3: Sales Prediction Using Python**

Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.
